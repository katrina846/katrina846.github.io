This project has been made in collaboration with Rijksmuseum van Oudheden. During this project, a boardgame with educational purposes was created for the museum with a corresponding website.

The website is accessible at https://katrina846.github.io.

De website generates a code from the user, namely the code 6650. Go to the page 'quiz' and type in the code 6650 in the input box. Subsequently, the quiz will appear.
